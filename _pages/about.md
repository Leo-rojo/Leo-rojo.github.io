## About Me
I am a Senior AI/ML Engineer with a Ph.D. in Telematic Engineering from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. 
I design and deploy end-to-end AI systems, working at the intersection of AI engineering and machine 
learning engineering.

My work spans multiple learning paradigms—including machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement 
learning, and generative AI—and covers the full AI lifecycle, from data-driven modeling to production 
deployment and monitoring. I am particularly interested in hybrid roles that combine system-level 
thinking with hands-on modeling and experimentation.

Previously, my background was in applied AI research for adaptive video streaming, where I worked on 
Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling and reinforcement learning–based control. This experience continues 
to inform how I approach building robust, measurable, and user-centric AI systems.

## Focus Areas
- Deep reinforcement learning and control with neural architectures,
  including value-based, policy-gradient, and actor–critic methods,
  as well as multi-agent systems
- End-to-end AI system development, spanning model design,
  training and evaluation, deployment, and operational monitoring
- LLM-based systems, with focus on prompting and reasoning strategies,
  fine-tuning, tokenization, and retrieval-augmented generation
- Hybrid AI systems that combine learning-based decision-making with explicit reasoning and action execution

## Current Interests
I am currently focused on extending my deep reinforcement learning background toward LLM-based and agent-oriented AI systems. I am exploring how large language models, advanced prompting and reasoning techniques, and retrieval-augmented generation can support decision-making, planning, and adaptive behavior in complex environments.
