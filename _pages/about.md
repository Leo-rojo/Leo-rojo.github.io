## About Me
I am a Senior AI/ML Engineer with a Ph.D. in Telematic Engineering from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I design and deploy end-to-end AI systems, operating across model-centric machine learning work and system-level AI engineering, from experimentation to production.

My work spans classical machine learning and deep learning, deep reinforcement learning, and LLM-based systems. I am particularly interested in hybrid roles where hands-on modeling and experimental prototyping are tightly coupled with robust productionization, including MLOps practices and reliable deployment pipelines.

Earlier in my career, I worked in applied AI research for adaptive video streaming, focusing on Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling, reinforcement learning–based adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms, video encoding, and transport-layer dynamics.

## Focus Areas
- Deep reinforcement learning and control with neural architectures,
  including value-based, policy-gradient, and actor–critic methods,
  as well as multi-agent systems
- End-to-end AI system development, spanning model design,
  training and evaluation, deployment, and operational monitoring
- LLM-based systems, with focus on prompting and reasoning strategies,
  fine-tuning, tokenization, and retrieval-augmented generation
- Hybrid AI systems that combine learning-based decision-making with explicit reasoning and action execution

## Current Interests
I am currently focused on extending my deep reinforcement learning background toward LLM-based and agent-oriented AI systems. I am exploring how large language models, advanced prompting and reasoning techniques, and retrieval-augmented generation can support decision-making, planning, and adaptive behavior in complex environments.
