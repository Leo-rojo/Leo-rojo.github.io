## About Me

I am a Senior AI/ML Engineer with a Ph.D. in Telematic Engineering from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. 
I design and deploy end-to-end AI systems, working at the intersection of AI engineering and machine 
learning engineering.

My work spans multiple learning paradigms—including machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement 
learning, and generative AI—and covers the full AI lifecycle, from data-driven modeling to production 
deployment and monitoring. I am particularly interested in hybrid roles that combine system-level 
thinking with hands-on modeling and experimentation.

Previously, my background was in applied AI research for adaptive video streaming, where I worked on 
Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling and reinforcement learning–based control. This experience continues 
to inform how I approach building robust, measurable, and user-centric AI systems.

## Current Interests

I am currently interested in building and scaling end-to-end AI systems that combine learning-based models 
with system-level decision-making. My focus is on applied AI in complex, security-critical environments, 
with particular interest in reinforcement learning, generative models, and robust evaluation in production 
settings.
