## About Me
I am a final-year PhD student in Telematic Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. 
I am currently in the process of writing my dissertation and expect to complete it soon. 
My research focuses on user empowerment in video streaming, particularly in HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) 
and the application of various machine learning methodologies. My main expertise lies in the distribution 
stage of the streaming pipeline, with a particular emphasis on Quality of Experience (QoE), 
Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms, and video compression.
