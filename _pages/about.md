## About Me
I have recently completed my Ph.D. in Telematic Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
My research focuses on user empowerment and the application of machine learning methodologies 
in video streaming, with a particular focus on HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS). 
My primary expertise lies in the distribution phase of the streaming pipeline, 
emphasizing Quality of Experience (QoE), Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms, and video compression.
