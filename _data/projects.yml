    description: "This is the codebase for the publication titled <i>In-Band Quality Notification from Users to ISPs</i>, 
    presenting <i>Youstall</i>, a prototype mechanism that enables users to signal YouTube stall duration to ISPs along 
    the server-client path. Users install this software to notify ISPs of QoE issues, enabling ISPs to improve connection quality without costly and often inefficient encrypted packet analysis.
    The software includes a user agent that detects stalls on YouTube and triggers a specific packet pattern by interacting with the YouTube interface, and an ISP agent that detects this pattern 
    for possible responsive action."

    description: "This is the codebase for the publication titled <i>Quality of Experience in Video Streaming: 
    Status Quo, Pitfalls, and Guidelines</i>. Through an in-depth analysis of two large databases—Waterloo-IV<sup>1</sup> and 
    iQoE<sup>2</sup>—as well as a comprehensive literature review, it identifies common pitfalls in QoE practices and models in 
    video streaming. These issues are classified into test conduct, model building, and model application, with 
    proposed solutions for improvement. This codebase specifically presents the database analyses."

    description: "This codebase accompanies the publication <i>Empowerment of Atypical Viewers via Low-Effort Personalized Modeling of Video Streaming Quality</i>. It introduces <i>iQoE</i>, a novel method for building personalized 
    QoE models by engaging individual users in a brief series of subjective assessments. The method leverages an active 
    learning paradigm with the RIGS sampler and XSVR modeler. This codebase includes the code to replicate all analyses 
    from the paper, the newly generated dataset, and the iQoE method itself."

    generator Jekyll and is built on the minimal-light theme<sup>1</sup>, which itself is based 
    on the minimal template<sup>2</sup>."

    description: "This repository contains code for the analysis of the <i>Waterloo-IV database</i>, 
    demonstrating how individual QoE (Quality of Experience) perception significantly differs 
    from group QoE perception. Since QoE models in the literature are constructed based on 
    group perception, the results of this analysis suggest that these models could greatly 
    benefit from personalization. This analysis represents the preliminary stage for the 
    publication <i>Empowerment of Atypical Viewers via Low-Effort Personalized Modeling of Video Streaming Quality</i>."

Due to the economic and technological complexity of the modern Internet, ISP-side QoE inference based on OTT assistance or out-of-band signaling sees low adoption. This paper presents IQN (in-band quality notification), a novel mechanism for signaling QoE impairments from an automated agent on the end-user device to the server-to-client ISP responsible for QoE-impairing congestion."
