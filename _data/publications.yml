    abstract: While ISPs (Internet service providers) strive to improve QoE (quality of experience) for end users, end-to-end traffic encryption by OTT (over-the-top) providers undermines independent inference of QoE by an ISP. Due to the economic and technological complexity of the modern Internet, ISP-side QoE inference based on OTT assistance or out-of-band signaling sees low adoption. This paper presents IQN (in-band quality notification), a novel mechanism for signaling QoE impairments from an automated agent on the end-user device to the server-to-client ISP responsible for QoE-impairing congestion. Compatible with multi-ISP paths, asymmetric routing, and other Internet realities, IQN does not require OTT support and induces the OTT server to emit distinctive packet patterns that encode QoE information, enabling ISPs to infer QoE by monitoring these patterns in network traffic. We develop a prototype system, YouStall, which applies IQN signaling to ISP-side inference of YouTube stalls. Cloud-based experiments with YouStall on YouTube Live streams validate IQN’s feasibility and effectiveness, demonstrating its potential for accurate user-assisted ISP-side QoE inference from encrypted traffic in real Internet environments.

    abstract: Remaining a dominant force in Internet traffic, video streaming captivates end users, service providers, and researchers. This paper takes a pragmatic approach to reviewing recent advances in the field by focusing on the prevalent streaming paradigm that involves delivering long-form two-dimensional videos over the best-effort Internet with client-side adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms and assistance from content delivery networks (CDNs). To enhance accessibility, we supplement the survey with tutorial material. Unlike existing surveys that offer fragmented views, our work provides a holistic perspective on the entire end-to-end streaming pipeline, from video capture by a camera-equipped device to playback by the end user. Our novel perspective covers the ingestion, processing, and distribution stages of the pipeline and addresses key challenges such as video compression, upload, transcoding, ABR algorithms, CDN support, and quality of experience. We review over 200 papers and classify streaming designs by their problem-solving methodology, whether based on intuition (simple heuristics), theory (formal optimization), or machine learning (generalizable data patterns). The survey further refines these methodology-based categories and characterizes each design by additional traits such as compatible codecs and use of super resolution. We connect the reviewed research to real-world applications by discussing the practices of commercial streaming platforms. Finally, the survey highlights prominent current trends and outlines future directions in video streaming.

    abstract: Quality of experience (QoE) becomes both the holy grail and a free-for-all in adaptive bitrate (ABR) video streaming. On the one hand, the design, operation, and evaluation of ABR algorithms increasingly rely on QoE. On the other hand, QoE frequently receives only cursory attention in this supporting role, with many of its important aspects treated with insufficient care. As a complex subjective notion, QoE is directly measurable through subjective tests, which incur evident overhead. While an objective QoE model represents a scalable automated means for QoE assessment, QoE models proliferate without consensus on their goodness due to numerous influence factors, construction methods, and usages. The model proliferation creates a false impression that proposing a new QoE model without a proper validation is acceptable. Because the multifaceted QoE problem involves separable and often separated tasks of test conducting, model building, and model using, this separation of concerns causes additional complications. By leveraging two large real datasets of individual QoE perception, this paper reviews the status quo in QoE, identifies various pitfalls, and offers guidelines for test conducting, model building, and model using, so as to foster high standards in future work on QoE in ABR video streaming.

    abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) and QoE models are of an increasing importance to networked systems. The traditional QoE modeling for video streaming applications builds a one-size-fits-all QoE model that underserves atypical viewers who perceive QoE differently. To address the problem of atypical viewers, this paper proposes iQoE (individualized QoE), a method that employs explicit, expressible, and actionable feedback from a viewer to construct a personalized QoE model for this viewer. The iterative iQoE design exercises active learning and combines a novel sampler with a modeler. The chief emphasis of our paper is on making iQoE sample-efficient and accurate. By leveraging the Microworkers crowdsourcing platform, we conduct studies with 120 subjects who provide 14,400 individual scores. According to the subjective studies, a session of about 22 minutes empowers a viewer to construct a personalized QoE model that, compared to the best of the 10 baseline models, delivers the average accuracy improvement of at least 42% for all viewers and at least 85% for the atypical viewers. The large-scale simulations based on a new technique of synthetic profiling expand the evaluation scope by exploring iQoE design choices, parameter sensitivity, and generalizability.

    abstract: Italy is considered one of the developed country in the field of agriculture in Europe. For many reasons, reliable classification of crops and mapping plays an important role in Precision Agriculture (PA). Increasing availability, improving spatial resolution and high revisit time of sentinel-2 satellite become more useful and play an important role in analyses for land cover, crop classification and other remote sensing applications. Most of the Crops with similar spectral characteristics can be distinguished by accumulating spectral information of different phenological stages. In literature, many solutions have been proposed to classify crops using multitemporal images acquired from various satellites equipped with multispectral imagery sensors. However, features and images selection from multispectral, multitemporal images still needs improvement. In this paper, crops phenological cycles are investigated using temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) patterns and major crop phenological information are used to select best multitemporal images for the input of random forest (RF) classifier to classify land cover and crops.
